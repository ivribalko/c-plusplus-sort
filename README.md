# Sorting algorithms in C++

Inspired by Stroustrup's interview in Fridman's podcast trying out C++.

Contains implementations of sorting algorithms sharing one base class.

Creates random arrays and prints the algorithms sorting time on those.

## TODO

- Template class.
- More algorithms.
- Verify pointers.
- vector to array.
- swap() vs rotate().
- Optimize implementations.
- C++ 20 format() and modules.
- Algorithm selection and details.
- Find better way to create and pass the instances.
